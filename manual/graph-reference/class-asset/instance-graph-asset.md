# Creating a Graph Asset instance

To use a `Class Asset` graph in your project, you can create the instance of that graph and save it to the Project.

A `Class Asset` is a ScriptableObject. ScriptableObjects is a data container that you can use to save large amounts of data, independent of class instances, One of the main use cases for ScriptableObjects is to reduce your Projectâ€™s memory usage by avoiding copies of values. For more information on ScriptableObject, see [the Unity User Manual on ScriptableObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html).

To create a new Graph Asset Instance, navigate to Project window and `Right click` to open menu then select `Create > Create Asset Instance` menu and select the available graph.
