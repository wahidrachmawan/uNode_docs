# Data types

All scripting in Unity is based on the C# programming language. C# is known as a "strongly typed" language. This means that all data and objects in uNode have a specific type. For example, a variable could be a number value with an `integer` type, or the object provided by a node's output port could be a GameObject.

Data types in uNode / C# is mainly divided into two categories:

- Value Data Types<br>
  Value types include simple types (such as int, float, bool, and char), enum types, struct types, and Nullable value types.
- Reference Data Types<br>
  Reference types include class types, interface types, delegate types, and array types.

## Common Data Types

Below are some commonly used types in uNode:


| Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Float](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/floating-point-numeric-types)      | A float is a numeric value, with or without decimal places.<br />For example, `0.25` or `13.1`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [Int](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/integral-numeric-types)        | An int / integer is a numeric value without decimal places.<br />For example, `3` or `200`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [Bool](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/bool)       | A Bool / Boolean is always either `true` or `false`. Booleans are useful for creating logic in your Script Graphs and for toggles.<br>For example, you could want your application to only do something if a condition is true.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [String](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/reference-types#the-string-type)     | A string is any sequence of characters or piece of text.<br />For example, `string`, `string123`, and `s` are all strings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [Char](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/char)       | A char is any single alphanumeric character from a string.<br />For example, `s` and `1` are both chars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Enum       | An enum is any finite enumeration of options.<br />They are usually displayed in a dropdown.<br />Unity has many available enums. <br />For example, a Force Mode enum could have a value of either `Force`, `Impulse`, `Acceleration`, or `Velocity Change`.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Vector     | A vector represents a set of float coordinates. Unity uses vectors for positions or directions.<br />Unity has 3 different types of vectors:<br> <li>Vector 2 - Contains X and Y coordinates for 2D spaces.</li><li>Vector 3 - Contains X, Y, and Z coordinates for 3D spaces. </li><li>Vector 4 - Contains X, Y, Z, and W coordinates for 4D space, such as parameters for shaders.</li>                                                      |
| [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) | A GameObject is the basic entity used in Unity scenes. All GameObjects have a name, a transform for their position and rotation in the scene, and a list of components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [List](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1?view=net-6.0)       | A list is an ordered collection of elements. The elements in a list can each have their own type, but they're usually the same type.<br />uNode, like C#, indexes items in a list that starts at 0. This means that the first element of a list is at the `0` index of the list. The second item is at the `1` index, the third is at the `2` index, and so on.                                                                    |
| [Dictionary](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2?view=net-6.0) | A dictionary is a collection of elements. Each element contains a unique key and a value. You can use the corresponding key to access and assign the values for an element in a dictionary.<br />For example, you could use a dictionary to organize the names and ages of a group of people. The person's name would be the key to the value of their age: `John` and `33` John and 3 would be a single element in the dictionary. |
| [Object](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/reference-types#the-object-type)     | An Object is a special type in Unity. If a data input port on a node has its type set to `Object`, the node can receive any of type as an input.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
