> [!TIP]
> To keep your graph organized, the use of function is very recommended instead of 'Event' inside `State Graph`.

## Return Types

All function have a return type. What does this mean? When you call a function, it can return a value or not. If it does not, it still has a return type and we call that a `void` return type. If a method is typed as `void`, it simply means that the function doesnâ€™t return a value to it's caller.

Characteristics of Parameters:
- Parameter has they own name, and a return type.
