# Data types

All scripting in Unity is based on the C# programming language. C# is known as a "strongly typed" language. This means that all data and objects in uNode have a specific type. For example, a variable could be a number value with an `integer` type, or the object provided by a node's output port could be a GameObject.

Data types in uNode / C# is mainly divided into two categories:

- Value Data Types<br>
  Value types include simple types (such as int, float, bool, and char), enum types, struct types, and Nullable value types.
- Reference Data Types<br>
  Reference types include class types, interface types, delegate types, and array types.

## Common Data Types

Below are some commonly used types in uNode:


| Type       | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Float      | A float is a numeric value, with or without decimal places.<br />For example, `0.25` or `13.1`. |
| Int        | An integer is a numeric value without decimal places.                                           |
| Bool       |                                                                                                 |
| String     |                                                                                                 |
| Char       |                                                                                                 |
| Enum       |                                                                                                 |
| Vector     |                                                                                                 |
| GameObject |                                                                                                 |
| List       |                                                                                                 |
| Dictionary |                                                                                                 |
| Object     |                                                                                                 |
