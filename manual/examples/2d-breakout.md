![](../../images/examples/example_2d-breakout.png)

This examples based on [2D Breakout Example Project](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/2d-breakout-example-project-107757).

This example was made by using CSharpParser to parse the following script:
- Ball_script.cs
- Brick_script.cs
- GameManager_script.cs
- GameOverDetector_script.cs
- Paddle_script.cs

Those script are parsed to C# Graphs and converted again to Runtime Graph ( Class Component and Component Singleton )
