# Welcome To uNode

Thank you for your interest in the uNode visual scripting tool for Unity! uNode allows empowering artists, designers and programmers to create gameplay mechanics, interactive systems and even C# script without writing a single line of code.

## About Visual Scripting

Visual Scripting enables you to create logic for games or applications without writing code. Visual Scripting uses visual, node-based graphs, which both programmers and non-programmers use to design final logic or create prototypes. Visual Scripting also has an API that programmers use for more advanced tasks, or for creating custom nodes for other team members.

Visual Scripting uses graphical elements, which represent functions, operators, or variables. You can then connect these nodes from their ports by using edges. Instead of having to write code line by line, you do everything visually.
